[Worm-Hole ](https://github.com/NOXCIS/Worm-Hole)  is an improvement on Wirehole by IAmStoxe. 

WireHole is a combination of WireGuard, PiHole, and Unbound in a docker-compose project with the intent of enabling users to quickly and easily create and deploy a personally managed full or split-tunnel WireGuard VPN with ad blocking capabilities (via Pihole), and DNS caching with additional privacy options (via Unbound).

## Added functionality

 - **WGDashboard** -as a front end dashboard to control wireguard server and user configs.
 
 - **Portainer** - for overall container management on a lightweight VPS.
 
 - **Setup Script** - to modify the docker-compose environment variables before the container stack is created.

## Working Containers

| Status | Container | Source |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
|  ✅ | Pihole  | pihole/pihole:latest |
|  ✅ | Unbound | klutchell/unbound:latest |
|  ✅ | WG-Dashboard | noxcis/wg-dashboard:latest | 
|  ✅ | Portainer | portainer/portainer:latest |


### Installing on Ubuntu

Worm-Hole can be installed on Ubuntu via the stackscript.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
sudo apt install git -y
sudo  sudo  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  apt-get  -o  Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef"  -o  Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold"  -qy  update
sudo  sudo  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  apt-get  -o  Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef"  -o  Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold"  -qy  upgrade
git  clone  https://github.com/NOXCIS/Worm-Hole.git
cd  Worm-Hole
chmod  +x  setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

 - The setup script can be left to run on its own where it will automatically assign the necessary environment variables or accept user input for the users desired environment variables.
 
 

### Installing on Linode VPS

Installation can be done via a public stackscript called Noxcis/ Worm-Hole. The script will auto set the following environment variables for the **Wireguard Dashboard** running at **your_server_ip:10086** & **Pihole** respectively.

 - Server IP Address
 - Pihole Time Zone
 - Pihole Password as **empty**
 - Number of WG Server Configs as **1**

## Acknowledgements
The code in this repo is influenced by [IAmStoxe's Wirehole](https://github.com/IAmStoxe/wirehole) project.

 Wirehole lacked the ability to easily generate new users and has recenlty stopped working due to updates to the parent project of Unbound-Docker, [Unbound-Docker by MatthewVance](https://github.com/MatthewVance/unbound-docker) . 

Therefore with the help of klutchell's unbound-docker Docker image & donaldzou's WGDashboard Dockerized by Noxcis, Wirehole was recreated as Worm-Hole.

However, the upstream projects and their authors most certainly also deserve credit for making this all possible.
