Nov 14 05:21:47.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8022, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
